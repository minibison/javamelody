The public demo of JavaMelody was running free thanks to <a href='http://www.cloudbees.com/'>CloudBees</a> RUN@Cloud. Unfortunately, CloudBees has <a href='https://www.cloudbees.com/faq-customers-runcloud'>shut down</a> RUN@Cloud, including this demo. So the demo is not available online anymore.

If you know where to restart the demo (freely if possible), please send a message to the [users' group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/javamelody).

CloudBees DEV@Cloud is still providing [continuous integration](ContinuousIntegration.md) and nightly builds.

~~There is a public demo of JavaMelody. It is based on the latest source in trunk and is continuously deployed with DEV@CLOUD by [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com). It features http (GWT), services (java interfaces) and SQL (jdbc, Mysql) monitoring in particular.~~

  * ~~First, you can play with this quick and dirty [GWT application](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/) to have some data~~
  * ~~Then you can view the charts and the statistics in the [monitoring reports](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring) (no password)~~
  * ~~Or you can view the same monitoring reports in the [Rich Desktop Application](http://demo.javamelody.cloudbees.net/monitoring?part=jnlp) (JavaWebStart, requires [JRE 1.7](http://java.com))~~
  * ~~Some JavaMelody features are not in the demo, see the [Screenshots](Screenshots.md) for other features.~~
